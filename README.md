# Digital Image Processing

The program was written in Java with the use of Swing. The following algorithms have been implemented: 
* [Gaussian Blur Filter](#gaussian-blur-filter)
* Unsharp Mask Filter
* Canny Edge Detector
* Morphological Operations:
     * Skeletonization
     * Contour Detection
* Nonlinear Filters:
    * Minimum Filter
    * Maximum Filter
    * Median Filter
    * Opening Filter
    * Closing Filter
    * Adaptive Median Filter
    * Bilateral Filter
